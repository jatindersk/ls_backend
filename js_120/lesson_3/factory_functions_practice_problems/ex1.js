//  two disadvantages of working with factory functions:

//  The objects created by the factory object creation pattern
//  consist of all the methods. This can consume a lot of
//  memory resources.

//  There is no way to determine whether an object was created by the
//  factory function / object factory. Thus, it makes it impossible to
//  determine the `type' of object. At best, we can only determine whether
//  an object has some specific characteristics.
